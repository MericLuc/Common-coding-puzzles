## What is this place about ?

This folder contains solutions to some **common coding questions**.

It will be **dedicated to C++** and aims to focus on _data-structures_, _complexity_ and _famous algorithms_ that are worth knowing.

NB : The questions are sorted by categories, largely inspired by [_AlgoExpert_ :sparkles:](https://www.algoexpert.io).

## What is next ?

My ToDo list for this repository :

* ADD alot of those questions as the time passes and I find new interesting questions.
* ADD questions statement so that I can remember what the problem was...

## Disclaimer

I have found alot of these questions online, especially on te following websites :

* [**_LeetCode_**](https://leetcode.com/problemset)
* [**_AlgoExpert_**](https://www.algoexpert.io)
* [**_CodeWars_**](https://www.codewars.com)
* [**_BitDegree_**](https://www.bitdegree.org)

If you feel like you might be interested in practicing this kind of data-structures related coding questions, those are really good places for sure !  :thumbsup:
